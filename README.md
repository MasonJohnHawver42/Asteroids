# Asteroids
asteroids, but with elastic collisions ( so it's really billards in space ). There will be a video on it soon.

# TODO
  - be able to break off pieces of the asteroid, so make them destroy-able.
  - uplift the graphics
  - add different types of weapons ( misiles, lasers, bullets, etc ).
  - add collisions between polygons ( convex then maybe concave ) ( currently everything is simplified to a circle when there is a collision; this method isn't horrible, so this probaly won't change ).
